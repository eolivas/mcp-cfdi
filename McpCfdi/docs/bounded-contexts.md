# Bounded Context Specification

This document defines the bounded context boundaries for the platform's core services. Each bounded context is self-contained: it specifies its aggregate root(s), the domain events it publishes, and the domain events it subscribes to.

---

## Identity Service

### Aggregate Roots

| Aggregate | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **User** | Represents a platform user account. Manages registration, authentication credentials, and profile data. Enforces uniqueness of email/username and password-complexity rules. |

### Value Objects

| Value Object | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Role** | Represents a user's authorization role (e.g., Admin, Member). Immutable; validated on construction. |

### Published Domain Events

| Event | Raised When |
|-------|-------------|
| **UserRegisteredEvent** | A new user account is successfully created via the registration flow. |
| **UserAuthenticatedEvent** | A user successfully completes authentication and a token is issued. |

### Subscribed Domain Events

The Identity service does not subscribe to domain events from other bounded contexts. It is an upstream authority that other services query for authentication and authorization decisions.

## {Entity} Service

### Aggregate Roots

| Aggregate | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **{Entity}** | Represents a customer {entity}. Contains one or more `{Entity}Line` entities and a computed `Total` (Money value object). Enforces the status lifecycle: `Pending → Placed → Shipped` and `Pending → Cancelled`, `Placed → Cancelled`. All invalid transitions are rejected. |

### Entities

| Entity | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **{Entity}Line** | A line item within an {Entity}. Holds a product reference, quantity (must be > 0), and unit price (Money). Created exclusively through a static factory method that enforces domain invariants. |

### Value Objects

| Value Object | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Money** | Immutable representation of a currency amount. Rejects negative amounts and non-ISO-4217 currency codes. Supports addition and multiplication operators. |

### Published Domain Events

| Event | Raised When |
|-------|-------------|
| **{Entity}CreatedEvent** | `{Entity}.Create(customerId, lines)` is called successfully, producing a new {Entity} in `Pending` status. Carries `{Entity}Id` and `CustomerId`. |
| **{Entity}PlacedEvent** | `{Entity}.Place()` is called on an {Entity} in `Pending` status, transitioning it to `Placed`. Carries `{Entity}Id`. |
| **{Entity}CancelledEvent** | `{Entity}.Cancel(reason)` is called on an {Entity} in `Pending` or `Placed` status, transitioning it to `Cancelled`. Carries `{Entity}Id` and `Reason`. |

### Subscribed Domain Events

The {Entity} service does not subscribe to domain events from other bounded contexts. It is a publisher of {entity}-lifecycle events consumed by downstream services (e.g., Notifications).

---

## Notifications Service

### Aggregate Roots

The Notifications service does not define its own aggregate roots. It is an event-driven service that reacts to domain events published by other bounded contexts and dispatches notifications (email, SMS, push) through configured delivery channels.

### Published Domain Events

The Notifications service does not publish domain events. Its responsibility is to consume events and produce side effects (sending notifications) rather than modifying domain state.

### Subscribed Domain Events

| Event | Source Context | Action Taken on Receipt |
|-------|---------------|------------------------|
| **{Entity}PlacedEvent** | {Entity} Service | Triggers the `SendEmailNotification` handler, which composes and sends a confirmation email to the customer via the configured email delivery infrastructure (SMTP or Amazon SES). |
