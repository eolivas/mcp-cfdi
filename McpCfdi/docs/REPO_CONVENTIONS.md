# Repository Conventions

This document defines the polyrepo naming convention and commit message format for all repositories on the platform.

---

## Polyrepo Naming Convention

Every service, frontend, and infrastructure repository follows a consistent naming scheme.

| Repository type       | Naming pattern       | Example              |
|-----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Service repository    | `<service>-service`  | `{service-name}-service`     |
| Frontend repository   | `frontend`           | `frontend`           |
| Infrastructure repository | `platform-infra` | `platform-infra`     |

### Required Top-Level Folders

Each repository MUST contain the following top-level directories:

```
<repo-root>/
├── src/          # Application source code
├── tests/        # Unit, integration, and property-based tests
├── .github/      # GitHub Actions workflows, CODEOWNERS, PR templates
└── docs/         # Architecture Decision Records, runbooks, API docs
```

---

## Conventional Commits

Every commit message MUST follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format.

### Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

- **type** — the category of change (see table below)
- **scope** — the area of the codebase affected (e.g., `{entity}`, `money`, `deps`)
- **description** — a concise summary in imperative mood, lowercase, no trailing period

### Commit Types

| Type       | When to use                                      |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `feat`     | A new feature or user-facing capability           |
| `fix`      | A bug fix                                         |
| `docs`     | Documentation-only changes                        |
| `style`    | Formatting, whitespace (no logic change)          |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring without behavior change        |
| `perf`     | Performance improvement                           |
| `test`     | Adding or updating tests                          |
| `chore`    | Tooling, CI, dependencies, maintenance            |
| `ci`       | CI/CD pipeline changes                            |
| `build`    | Build system or external dependency changes       |

### Examples

```
feat({entity}): add cancellation endpoint
fix(money): handle zero-amount edge case
chore(deps): update EF Core to 8.0.x
docs(adr): add ADR-006 for caching strategy
test(domain): add property tests for Money addition
```

### Breaking Changes

Breaking changes MUST include a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer in the commit body. The footer explains what changed and what consumers need to do.

```
feat({entity}): change {entity} ID from int to UUID

BREAKING CHANGE: {Entity} IDs are now UUIDs. All API consumers must update
their client code to send and receive string-based IDs instead of integers.
Existing {entities} will be migrated with new UUID identifiers.
```

When a breaking change is introduced, the commit type line MAY also append `!` after the scope for additional visibility:

```
feat({entity})!: change {entity} ID from int to UUID
```
